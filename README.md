Title: Mario Project

Description:

The "Mario Project" is a simple text-based game that allows you to control a character and make choices to interact with the game world. Here's a brief overview of how the game works:

1. **Character Class:** The game starts by creating a character. The character has a name, a life, and a score. The character can be affected by three actions: kicking, punching, and being stabbed.

2. **Gameplay:** The player enters the character's name, and the game begins. The player has a set amount of life points (initially 3), and the goal is to maximize the character's score by making choices.

3. **Actions:** The player can choose from four actions:
   - **Kick:** This action adds 10 points to the character's score.
   - **Punch:** This action adds 5 points to the character's score.
   - **Stab:** This action subtracts 1 life point from the character.
   - **Quit:** This allows the player to exit the game.

4. **Win/Lose Condition:** The game continues until the character's life reaches 0. When the life is depleted, the game is over.

5. **Display:** The game displays the character's current life and score after each action. It also informs the player about the result of each action.

6. **Invalid Input Handling:** The game handles invalid input gracefully and prompts the player to try again.

7. **Game Over:** When the character's life reaches 0, the game displays "Game over."

8. **Restart:** The game can be restarted by running it again.

This "Mario Project" is a simple demonstration of a text-based game in Python. Players can make choices to influence the character's score and life, and the game continues until the character runs out of life. You can further modify and expand upon this project to create a more complex and engaging game.
